        <img class="kol_image" src="jama masjid.jpg">
        <br>
  <p id="paragraph">
    Jama Masjid – also known as the Friday Mosque – is the largest mosque in India. The dimensions are astounding: there is space for 25,000 people here. The mosque is located in the centre of old Delhi and is one of the city’s main attractions.

With its characteristic red sandstone and white marble construction, the mosque is a masterpiece of Mughal architecture. The two 40 metre high minarets are also eye-catching. You can climb one of these and enjoy a panorama view of Delhi from above.

We can highly recommend visiting the mosque first thing in the morning. We were there shortly after opening and other than us, there were only a few people there who had come to pray. Perfect lighting, perfect atmosphere!

        <br>
  <p>
    Delhi’s landmark and the most famous sight in Old Delhi is the Red Fort. It is located just a stone’s throw away from the Jama Masjid. The name says it all: this fortress was building using red standstone. The Red Fort has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2007.
<br>
The entire area is very extensive and of course worth seeing, but we think that something more could be done with it. Perhaps it was the midday heat that dampened our spirits a little.

        <br>
  <p>
    The Humayun Mausoleum is a little reminiscent of the Taj Mahal and is said to have even served as its template. 
    <br>The mausoleum is considered one of the oldest Mughal tombs in Delhi and one of the most magnificent buildings in the city.

    <br>
    <p>
      Butter Chicken has a good history associated with Moti Mahal, Daryaganj. Back in the 1950s, some tandoori chicken pieces were left at night. So, in the morning, the cook accidentally tossed tandoori Chicken in tomato, online and butter. From then, the rest is history. It has been the signature popular food of Delhi that people started cooking in cream, tomato, onion gravy with a pinch of sugar.<br> So, if you are ever visiting Delhi, go straight to Moti Mahal, and they have this signature dish available in its raw taste.
